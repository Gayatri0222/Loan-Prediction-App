# Loan Approval Prediction System Using Logistic Regression and Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Loan Approval Prediction System** that classifies loan applications as **Approved** or **Rejected** based on applicant and loan-related details.

The machine learning model is built using **Logistic Regression**, while the frontend is developed with **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use web interface for real-time predictions.

---

## 📊 Dataset and Features

The dataset contains applicant information and loan details with the following key features:

* **Demographics**: `person_age`, `person_gender`, `person_education`, `person_income`
* **Employment & Finance**: `person_emp_exp`, `person_home_ownership`, `credit_score`, `loan_percent_income`
* **Loan Attributes**: `loan_amnt`, `loan_intent`, `loan_int_rate`
* **Credit History**: `cb_person_cred_hist_length`, `previous_loan_defaults_on_file`
* **Target Variable**: `loan_status` (1 = Approved, 0 = Rejected)

---

## 🛠 Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values in `credit_score` and `employment experience`.
* Applied **label encoding** and **one-hot encoding** for categorical features.
* Normalized numerical variables for uniform scale.
* Split dataset into **80% training** and **20% testing**.

## 🤖 Model Building

The system uses **Logistic Regression**:

* Chosen for its simplicity and interpretability in binary classification.
* Regularization applied to avoid overfitting.
* Compared with other baseline approaches but Logistic Regression was finalized.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated using:

* **Accuracy** – Correct classification rate.
* **Precision & Recall** – Useful for measuring true approvals vs. false approvals.
* **Confusion Matrix** – To analyze misclassifications.

✅ Logistic Regression provided reliable accuracy and balanced performance across both classes.

## 🌐 Streamlit Application

The trained model was deployed using **Streamlit** to provide a user-friendly interface:

* User input fields for applicant details (income, credit score, loan amount, etc.).
* Preprocessing pipeline integrated within the app.
* Real-time output: **“Loan Approved”** or **“Loan Rejected”**.
* Minimal and intuitive UI for non-technical users.

---

## 🚀 Final Outcome

* A working **Loan Approval Prediction System** that predicts loan eligibility.
* Demonstrates how **Logistic Regression** can be applied in financial decision-making.
* Fully interactive and easy to use through a web-based interface.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Try **ensemble models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) for improved accuracy.
* Add **explainability** (SHAP, LIME) to interpret predictions.
* Integrate with a **database** to store applicant info & predictions.
* Implement **authentication** for secure, role-based access.
